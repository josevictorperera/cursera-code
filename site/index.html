        Body of Christ, be my salvation, Blood of Christ, let me drink your wine, Water flowing from the side of Christ, wash me clean, Passion of Christ, strengthen me, Kind Jesus, hear my prayer, hide me within your wounds, and keep me close to you. Defend me from the evil enemy and call me at the hour of my death to the fellowship of your saints that I might sing your praise with them for all eternity. Amen

        <div>May God the Father who made us bless us. May God the Son send his healing among us. May God the Holy Spirit move within us and give us eyes to see with, ears to hear with, and hands that your work might be done. May we walk and preach the word of God to all. May the angel of peace watch over us and lead us at last by God’s grace to the Kingdom. Amen.
